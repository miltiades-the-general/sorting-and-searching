# Python implementation for standard searching and sorting algorithms

### Technology
python == ^3.0
collections
heapq
typing

### Usage
Searching algorithms are part of the SearchingAlgorithms class and consist of the following algorithms:
* linear search
* binary search
* breadth first search (On Graph)
* depth first search (On Graph)
* Kruskal MST (On disjoint set type)
* Prim's MST (On disjoint set type)
* Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (On graph type)
Applying these searching algorithms in most cases will return a queried value, (In the case of Prim and Kruskal will return a multiple spanning tree, in Dijkstra will return distances to each node).

Sorting algorithms are part of the SortingAlgorithms class and consist of the following algorithms:
* bubble sort
* bucket sort
* insertion sort
* selection sort
* quicksort
* heap sort
* radix sort
* merge sort
